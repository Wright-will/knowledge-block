# KnowledgeBlock
KnowledgeBlock turns Airtable into a simple but powerful knowledge base. It helps your team keep content up-to-date and easy-to-find as your projects grow and evolve.

This is just one of many great projects built for the [Airtable Blocks Contest](https://airtable.devpost.com/). If you're interested in custom Airtable blocks, be sure to check out the others, too! ðŸ˜Š

# Features

* Comment on pages to help your team improve them.

* Schedule reviews to keep your pages up-to-date.
* Assign reviews to the teammates who know a topic best.
* Find all of your pages that need to be reviewed.
* Ask your teammates questions to learn more about a topic.
* Answer others' questions and include links to relevant pages.
* Organize pages in infinitely-nestable folders.

# How to remix this block
1. Duplicate [this template base](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invhi054cKKpI4gWO&inviteToken=76cec3e20cc6e56e333170320bc7575f5386b7fa4d9d46430332dac77c8f5b1d) or add the same tables, fields, and views to an existing base.
2. Create a new block in your base.
   * See [Create a new block](https://airtable.com/developers/blocks/guides/hello-world-tutorial#create-a-new-block).
   * Select "Remix from Github" as your template.
3. From the root of your new block, run `block run`.
